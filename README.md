### Webhooks

- webhooks are needed to send messages to a designated URL when the second computer uses the built malware.

- **Discord Webhook**: If you want to send notifications to a Discord channel, select this option. You will need to provide a valid Discord webhook URL. Here's how to obtain it:

    1. Go to your Discord server.
    2. Open **Server Settings** > **Integrations** > **Webhooks**.
    3. Create a new webhook and copy the URL.
  
    Paste this URL when prompted by the builder.

- **Webhook.site**: For temporary or testing purposes, you can use [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site). This service gives you a temporary webhook URL for testing.
